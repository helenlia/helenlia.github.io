<p>A remake of the first dungeon in The Legend of Zelda NES game. Features all rooms, enemies, 
    and core mechanics. A custom level featuring "Simon Says" puzzle mechanics can be accessed by pressing "4". </p>
<p><b>Contributions: </b>Implemented all player weapons (including sword, bow, boomerang, 
    and bombs) and enemy item drops and collectables. Programmed player and enemy health and damage scripts, including knockback.

<p>Player traverses through the map and solves puzzles by toggling between a red map and blue map.</p>
<p><b>Contributions: </b> This was a solo project, so I implemented all game mechanics, 
    including player movement, color toggling, and puzzle elements such as color-switching platforms, toggled platforms, and pushable blocks. 
    Background assets were created by <a href="https://trixelized.itch.io/desert-ruins">Trixie</a>, sound effects are from
    <a href="https://coffeevalenbat.itch.io/sweet-sounds-sfx-pack">CoffeeValenBat</a>, and music is from <a href="https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle">Brackeys</a>.
    All other sprites were created by me.
